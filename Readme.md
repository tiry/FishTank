# About

## Goal

This project aims at simulating a group of fish swiming in a tank.

The swarm model is taken from this [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022519302930651?via%3Dihub) that also proposes a [2D simulator](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/flockn-roll/).

The idea is to produce something similar but in a 3D scene where user can "swim with the fishes".

## 3D Rendering

This project uses [Panda3D](https://www.panda3d.org/) and python:

 - seems to be performant enough
 - easy to reuse 3D assets from Blender (GLTF)

 # Run

 ## Install needed packages

    pip install numpi panda3d==1.10.14

## Execute

   python3 swarm.py
